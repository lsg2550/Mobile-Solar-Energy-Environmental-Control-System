# Remote-Solar-Energy-and-Environmental-Control-System

This project is based on the utilization of already available energy storage resources to harness solar energy, provide a system to use it, and monitor and control the operation of onboard systems of a vehicle in stationary or mobile state. The battery of a vehicle is underutilized most of the time while being stationary in a parking lot.  Adding a solar panel to the vehicle with a charge controller provides a charging mechanism for the already installed battery.  This allows for the operation of onboard systems, such as air circulation and surveillance, which are normally shutdown to avoid draining the battery.  However, this calls for a sophisticated control and monitoring system which needs to monitor the battery to avoid draining it beyond a certain percent depending on the type of battery, control onboard systems to keep them operational at a specified level, and at the same time send alerts and provide remote access to a user. Using a Raspberry Pi, a small hardened computer system, with a Sensing HAT, an add-on that is able to sense environmental variables, data can be retrieved from customized inputs and signals can be provided to trigger other systems.
