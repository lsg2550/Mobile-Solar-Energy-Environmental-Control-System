# Remote-Solar-Energy-and-Environmental-Control-System

This project is based on utilization of already available energy storage resources to harness solar energy, and provide a system to use it, and monitor and control the operation of onboard systems of a vehicle in stationary or mobile state. The battery of a vehicle is underutilized most of the time while being stationary in a parking lot.  Adding a solar panel to the vehicle with charge controller provides a charging mechanism for the already installed battery.  This allows the operation of onboard systems, such as air circulation and surveillance, which are normally shutdown to avoid draining the battery.  However, this calls for a sophisticated control and monitoring system which needs to monitor the battery to avoid draining it beyond a certain percent depending on the type of the battery, and control onboard systems to keep them operational at the specified level, and at the same time send alerts and provide remote access to a user.  Raspberry Pi with Sensing HAT is a small hardened computer system that is able to sense environmental variables including data from customized inputs and provide signals to trigger other systems.
